## nac_distributions

This file contains the scripts needed to compute the distributions of the nonadiabatic couplings for the states computed in step3.

In `nac_dist.py`, the user can following the #comments for further details. As far as the reading of the files (from step 3) goes, this operation is the same as it is in the scripts for computing tNACS, state energies vs. time, DOS, etc.
