# Master README.md for the repository
The folders "cubic" and "tetragonal" refer to the crystal symmetry of the CsPbI3 perovskite. In each folder, the following subfolders exist:

## 1. Geometry optimization
See the folder, opt

## 2. "Step 1" - Molecular dynamics calculations
See the folder, md

## 3. "Step 2" - Computing overlaps, time-overlaps, and Kohn-Sham orbital energies. Computing LR-TD-DFT calculations
See the folder, step2

## 4. Computing projected density of states for the Kohn-Sham orbtial basis
See the folder, pdos 

## 5. Computing total density of states for the Single-Particle and Many-Body bases
See the folder, dos

## 6. Computing and plotting time-averaged nonadiabatic couplings, extracting and plotting states' energies vs. time 
See the folder, dos

## 7. Computing and plotting probability distributions for the nonadiabatic couplings in the Single-Particle and Many-Body bases  
See the folder, nac_distributions

## 8. Computing and plotting the degree of configurational mixing in the LR-TD-DFT electronic states
See the folder, excitation analysis

## 9. "Step 3" - Transforming from the basis of Kohn-Sham orbitals to the basis of single Slater determinants (Single-Particle) and the Many-body basis
See the folder, step3

## 10. "Step 4" - Computing, fitting, and plotting the nonadiabatic dynamics
See the folder, namd
