## 3. "Step 1" - Molecular dynamics calculations
See the folder, md

## 4. "Step 2" - Computing overlaps, time-overlaps, and Kohn-Sham orbital energies. Computing LR-TD-DFT calculations
See the folder, step2

## 5. Computing projected density of states for the Kohn-Sham orbtial basis
See the folder, pdos 

## 6. Computing total density of states for the Single-Particle and Many-Body bases
See the folder, dos

## 7. Computing and plotting time-averaged nonadiabatic couplings, extracting and plotting states' energies vs. time 
See the folder, dynamical_analysis

## 8. Computing and plotting probability distributions for the nonadiabatic couplings in the Single-Particle and Many-Body bases  
See the folder, nac_distributions

## 9. Computing and plotting the degree of configurational mixing in the LR-TD-DFT electronic states
